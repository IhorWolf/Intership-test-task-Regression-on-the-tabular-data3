Mashine Learning task 

The repository contains files from jupyter notebook and python and an excel file with simulation results
For my reasons, the modeling did not turn out as it should, maybe something needs to be corrected, but sometimes I did not have time.
During the first runs of the models on the test data, the model showed itself well and produced data similar to the training data.
I chose the Decision Tree model for simulation, as in my opinion it had the best parameters in terms of r2 score and rmse.
But I am inclined to think that the model is overfitted, which does not give an accurate result that can be trusted.
I think the model can be run only on selected predictors, such as 6-7-8, and the model will show itself well on these parameters, I tested, but I attached the solution with all predictors
